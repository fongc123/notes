# Introduction

<span style = "color:lightblue">Machine learning</span> is a geometry problem. Given a dataset, a curve is fitted to best describe the data; however, the meaning of the curve changes according to the problem and data.
- <span style = "color:lightblue">classification</span>: the curve separates data points into **classes**
- <span style = "color:lightblue">regression</span>: the curve estimates the trend of data points as close as possible

The simplest curve-fitting is linear, where there are only two variables and a line is drawn based on their data. Additional <span style = "color:lightblue">features</span> (i.e., additional variables) can be added or a nonlinear model can 

While each <span style = "color:lightblue">machine learning model</span> is trained on different data, the task is still the same and can be applied to other datasets (i.e., *all data is the same*).
