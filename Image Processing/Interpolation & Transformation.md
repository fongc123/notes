# Image Interpolation

<span style = "color:lightblue">Image interpolation</span> is the process of using **known input image pixel values** to estimate new pixel values at unknown locations. Interpolation is commonly used in zooming, shrinking, rotating, and geometrically correcting digital images.

There are several **resampling methods** to perform interpolation.
- <span style = "color:lightblue">nearest neighbor</span>: assign the intensity value of the nearest neighbor to the new location
- <span style = "color:lightblue">bilinear</span>:
