<span style = "color:lightblue">Morphological image processing</span> refers to the process of extracting image components for representation and description of region shape, such as boundaries, skeletons, and convex hulls. Applications include edge detection and blob detection.

Morphological image processing is based on [[#Set Theory|set theory]].

# Set Theory
It is the branch of mathematics that studies <span style = "color:lightblue">sets</span>, which are the collections of objects.

An object $a$ can be or not be <span style = "color:lightblue">an element</span> of the set $A$.

\begin{align}
	\text{part of set:}&\quad a\in A \\
	\text{not in set:}&\quad a\
