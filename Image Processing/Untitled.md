# Image Processing
Image processing pertains to the manipulation, such as geometric transformation, enhancement, restoration, image segmentation, feature extraction and object recognition, of images which consist of **multiple finite elements** (i.e., a <span style = "color:lightblue">pixel</span>).

An <span style = "color:lightblue">image</span> is defined as a two-dimensional function $f(x,y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are spatial coordinates and $f$ is the intensity or gray level of the image at that point.

Some images include natural image, satelite image, MRI image, microscopy image, CT scans, ultrasound scans, and infrared images. Images are inputted into computers as **an array of numbers**.

<span style = "color:lightblue">Digital image processing</span> refers to the process of image processing with a digital computer.
