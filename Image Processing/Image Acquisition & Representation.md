# Image Acquisition & Representation

## Human Visual System
A <span style = "color:lightblue">human visual system</span> consists of the eyes which are responsible for creating sensory signals and the central nervous system which is responsible for processing the sensory signals.

### The Eye
The human eye consists of several structures for the eye to perform its functions.
- <span style = "color:lightblue">cornea and sclera</span>: protects the eye with tough and transparent tissue
- <span style = "color:lightblue">choroid</span>: provide nutrients through blood vessels and control the size of the pupil
- <span style = "color:lightblue">retina</span>: contains light receptors
- <span style = "color:lightblue">lens</span>: focuses light on to the retina

There are two types of <span style = "color:lightblue">light receptors</span>: cones and rods. <span style = "color:lightblue">Cones</span> are responsible for photopic vision (i.e., higher light levels). They provide color and spatial details and are denser in the center of the retina. <span style = "color:lightblue">Rods</span> are responsible for scotopic vision (i.e., lower light levels). Rods are more abundant than cones by approximately 20 times.

By varying the **shape of the lens**, the <span style = "color:lightblue">focus length</span> is adjusted, and, accordingly, focusing at different distances is achieved. The light receptors convert the focused light into electrical energy which will be decoded by the brain.
