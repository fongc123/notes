# Frequency Filtering

Established by Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, the <span style = "color:lightblue">Fourier transformation</span> converts spatial coordinates to frequency components $u$ and $v$.
- simplify problems
- decrease complexity
- some operations in the frequency domain are easier 

A <span style = "color:lightblue">Fourier series</span> can represent **any periodic function** as a discrete weighted sum of sine and cosine functions.

A <span style = "color:lightblue">Fourier transform</span> is a mathematical transform that decomposes **an arbitrary function with finite duration (non-periodic function)** into weighted integrals of sine and cosine functions.

> [!INFO]
> A Fourier transform is lossless (i.e., the original spatial function can be recovered from the frequency domain).
