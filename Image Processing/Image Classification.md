Like [[Classification|classification]], image classification assigns a class label to input images. A classification system looks for a set of <span style = "color:lightblue">patterns</span> (i.e., a spatial arrangement of **features**) in an image that are characteristic to a class.

Features can be extracted [[Feature Extraction|manually]] (e.g., signature, boundary, region, texture, SIFT) or with [[Convolutional Neural Networks|data-driven methods]].
