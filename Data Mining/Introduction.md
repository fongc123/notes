# Introduction

<span style = "color:lightblue">Data mining</span> is the process of extracting **interesting** (non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful) patterns or knowledge from an **abundance** of data. Ideally, this extraction and analysis process is done automatically or semi-automatically.

> [!INFO]
> Data mining is not the same as database querying.

Data visualization consists of several disciplines: statistics, database technology, algorithms (complexity), machine learning, visualization, and pattern recognition.

> [!NOTE]
> In 2003, there were **five exabytes ($10^{18}$ bytes)** of digital data. Now, the same amount of data is created in two days. In 2012, the world data was expanded to **2.72 zettabytes**.

## Data Types & Sources

The **major sources of abundant data** are mainly **social** (e.g., news and social networking), **business** (e.g., web, e-commerce, transactions, and stocks), and **science** (e.g., sensors, bioinformatics, and scientific simulations). New efficient ways to analyze vast quantities of raw data must be developed.

Additionally, there are several **data repositories**.
- relational data: a set of data where each entry contains the same attributes
- transctional data: a special type of relational data where each entry is a <span style = "color:lightblue">transaction</span> and involves a set of items
- graph data: data that consists of <span style = "color:lightblue">nodes</span> and <span style = "color:lightblue">edges</span> to capture relationships between objects (e.g., social networking or fraud data)
- sequence data: ordered sequence of entries (e.g., DNA sequence)
- time series data: sequence data with measurements of time
- spatial data: data with **geographical attributes** (e.g., spatial coordinates)
- text & multimedia data: databases that contain text and multimedia data (e.g., images and videos) respectively
