# Introduction

<span style = "color:lightblue">Data mining</span> is the process of extracting **interesting** (non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful) patterns or knowledge from an abundance of data. Ideally, this extraction and analysis process is done automatically or semi-automatically.

> [!INFO]
> Data mining is not the same as database querying.
