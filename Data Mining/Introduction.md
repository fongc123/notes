# Introduction

<span style = "color:lightblue">Data mining</span> is the process of extracting **interesting** (non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful) patterns or knowledge from an **abundance** of data. Ideally, this extraction and analysis process is done automatically or semi-automatically.

> [!INFO]
> Data mining is not the same as database querying.

> [!NOTE]
> In 2003, there were **five exabytes ($10^{18}$ bytes)** of digital data. Now, the same amount of data is created in two days. In 2012, the world data was expanded to **2.72 zettabytes**.
