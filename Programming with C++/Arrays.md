# Arrays
Arrays allow information to be grouped under one identifier. An <span style = "color:lightblue">array</span> is a collection of <span style = "color:lightblue">homogeneous objects</span> (i.e., objects of the same type).
## One-dimensional Arrays
The syntax of initializing an array is shown below. The size of the array must be a positive constant.

```C++
<DATA_TYPE> <ARRAY_NAME> [ <SIZE> ];
```

Each element is stored consecutively in memory and **takes up space** equivalent to the **size of the data type**. Additionally, the syntax of assigning a value at a specified index of an array is shown below.

```C++
<ARRAY_NAME> [ <INDEX ] = <VALUE>;
```

C++ will not complain if the **index is greater than the size of the array** (i.e., index out of bounds). This is a common cause of a <span style = "color:lightblue">run-time segmentation fault error</span>. An out-of-bound array access will return <span style = "color:lightblue">garbage values</span>.

Constant arrays (denoted with `const`) prohibit modification of their elements.

Access to uninitialized elements (i.e., elements with no value stored yet) also return garbage values. Alternatively, an array can be initialized with values.

```C++
<DATA_TYPE> <ARRAY_NAME> [ <SIZE> ] = { <VALUE1>, <VALUE2>, ... };
```

If **not enough values** are specified, the remaining elements are initialized to `0`. If **too many values** are specified, a <span style = "color:lightblue">compilation error</span> occurs. The above syntax can only be used once when the array is first initialized.

## Passing an Array into a Function
The <span style = "color:lightblue">array identifier</span>, its data type, and the size of the array must be passed into the function.

The array is passed by value (i.e., its name â†’ its memory addresss), while its elements are passed by reference. Thus, any changes to the array's elements in the function are permanent.

## Multi-dimensional Arrays
An $N$-dimensional array can be created with the following syntax.

```C++
<DATA_TYPE> <ARRAY_NAME> [ <SIZE1> ] [ <SIZE2> ] ... [ <SIZEN> ];
```

Each element is stored consecutively in memory, where the **last dimension index** `SIZEN` is iterated through first and the **first dimension index** is iterated through last. The array elements are stored in <span style = "color:lightblue">row-major order</span>.

For example, in `int arr[3][5]`, the elements `arr[0][0]` to `arr[0][4]` are iterated through before the first dimension index is incremented (`arr[1][0]`).

Thus, the last dimension index runs the fastest, while the first dimension index runs the slowest.

Both code blocks below are valid multi-dimensional array initialization syntaxes.

```C++
<TYPE> <NAME> [ <SIZE1> ] [ <SIZE2> ] = { { ... }, { ... }, ... };
```

```C++
<TYPE> <NAME> [ <SIZE1> ] [ <SIZE2> ] = { ..., ..., ..., ... };
```
