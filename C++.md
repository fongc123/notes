# Introduction to Programming with C++
A **computer program** is a set of machine-readable <span style = "color:lightblue">machine-readable instructions</span> for a computer to accmplish a task.

**John von Neumann**, a mathematician in 1945, designed the computer architecture still used today. The computer reads information stored in <span style = "color:lightblue">memory</span> and sends it to the <span style = "color:lightblue">central processing unit (CPU)</span> and the <span style = "color:lightblue">arithmetic logic unit (ALU)</span> for processing.

The following table summarizes the *readability* of different types of programming languages.
**language** | **readability**
:------:|:------:
machine | *???*
assembly | hard
high-level | easy
