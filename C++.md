# Introduction to Programming with C++
A **computer program** is a set of machine-readable <span style = "color:lightblue">machine-readable instructions</span> for a computer to accmplish a task.

**John von Neumann**, a mathematician in 1945, designed the computer architecture still used today. The computer reads information stored in <span style = "color:lightblue">memory</span> and sends it to the <span style = "color:lightblue">central processing unit (CPU)</span> and the <span style = "color:lightblue">arithmetic logic unit (ALU)</span> for processing.

The following table summarizes the *readability* of different types of programming languages.

|**language** | **readability** |
|:------------:|:---------------:|
|   machine    |      *???*      |
|   assembly   |      hard       |
|  high-level  |      easy       |

**Maintaining** means to modify and enhance the code. High-level languages, such as C++, are easier to remember, faster to write, less error-prone and easier to maintain than low-level languages.

A **compiler** (e.g., gcc/g++ or VC++) translates source code from higher-level programming languages to machine code which is then run. This document uses the **GNU gcc/g++ compiler**.

Invented by Danish computer scientist **Bjarne Stroustrup** in 1998, C++ is an <span style = "color:lightblue">object-oriented programming (OOP)</span> language and focuses on manipulating <span style = "color:lightblue">objects</span> to accomplish tasks. Compared to other programming languages, C++ is more low-level, allowing instructions to be sent directly to computer components.
