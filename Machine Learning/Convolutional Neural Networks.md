<span style = "color:lightblue">Convolutional neural networks</span> are commonly used in image classification and object recognition. This type of neural network uses image kernels commonly used in image processing (*see [[Spatial Filtering|convolution and filtering]]*).

Convolutional neural networks have a local <span style = "color:lightblue">receptive field</span>, as layers are only connected to a <u>local</u> subset of units in the previous layer.

Higher layers learn increasingly more complex features as the receptive field grows.
