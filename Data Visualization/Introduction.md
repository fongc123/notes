# Introduction

Data visualization is the computer-supported and interactive representation of data to amplify cognition. Data is changed into a visual form to provide insights to users.

<span style = "color:lightblue">Ansombe's Quartet</span> is an example of the benefits of using data visualization. Four graphs of different datasets are shown below.

**All datasets have the same arithmetic mean, standard deviation, $r$ coefficient, and linear regression.** But, the distribution of the individual points are significantly different.

The type of visualization is also important, as incorrect chart choices will create little to no insight. The figure below demonstrates the differences between a <span style = "color:lightblue">boxplot</span> and a <span style = "color:lightblue">violin plot</span>.

A violin plot will show deeper distribution of data points in addition to the standard statistical descriptions, such as the interquartile range and the median.

Commonly used chart types include **distribution**, **correlation**, **ranking**, **part of a whole**, **evolution**, **map**, and **flow**.
