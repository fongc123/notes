# Perception

<span style = "color:lightblue">Perception</span> is the processing of input signals, while <span style = "color:lightblue">cognition</span> is the understanding and interpretation of those signals.
- encoding: transform data into visual form
- decoding: transform visual form into insights

<span style = "color:lightblue">Heuristics</span> is the process of applying known concepts to the understanding of new concepts.

A graphical method is successful only if the decoding is effective. It should be <span style = "color:lightblue">salient</span>, so that users can **easily** detect patterns and extract insights from the graphical visualization.

## Human Visual System
The human visual system has a high bandwidth to the brain as it is responsible for 70% of all receptors in the brain, 40% of the cortex, and four billion neurons. It retrieves much more visual stimuli than the brain can process.

## Static Patterns
<span style = "color:lightblue">Gestalt psychology</span> is a school of psychology that "emphasizes that organisms perceive entire patterns or configurations and not merely individual components".

> [!INFO]
> In German, *Gestalt* is interpreted as "pattern" or "configuration".

The Gestalt principles are **proximity**, **similarity**, **figure-ground**, **continuity**, **closure**, and **connection**.

### Proximity
The relationship of objects is emphasized by the proximity and the spatial concentration of the objects.

Due to the proximity arrangement, it is assumed that the circles on the left are related with each other, while that of on the right are not.

### Similarity
The relationship of objects is emphasized by the similarity of properties that the objects
