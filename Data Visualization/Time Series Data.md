# Time Series Data
A <span style = "color:lightblue">time series</span> is a series of data points indexed, listed, or graphed in chronological order. It is a sequence of discrete time data.
- timestamp
- granularity
- temporal pattern (e.g., cyclic)

Analysis.
- trend & outlier
- correlation
- dependency

## Line Graph
A <span style = "color:lightblue">line graph</span> or <span style = "color:lightblue">dot plot</span> directly displays the numeric values of two quantitative attributes.

|          **Data**           |    **Mark**    |          **Channels**          |       **Task**        | **Scalability** |
|:---------------------------:|:--------------:|:------------------------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------:|
| Two quantitative attributes | Points & lines | Horizontal & vertical position | Find trend & extremes | Multiple lines  |

On the other hand, a <span style = "color:lightblue">slope graph</span> displays the change magnitude of quantitative attributes.

## Area Graph
Similar to a line graph, the x-axis represents time, while y-axis represents attribute values.

To improve space efficiency, juxtaposition techniques are used to combine and shrink charts. Example charts include the <span style = "color:lightblue">horizon chart</span> and the <span style = "color:lightblue">ridgeline plot</span>.

## Bar Graph
A <span style = "color:lightblue">bar graph</span> can display the change of a quantitative variable over time. For multiple variables, a multi-bar chart or multiple single-bar charts can be used.

## Metaphorical Idioms
In these special charts, the use of metaphors and symbolism incorporates the context of the data into the design, such as **radial timeline**, **calendar**, or **river**. For example, the use of a calendar view as the base design of a chart is applicable to data about daily and monthly car accidents.

River or road metaphors also create a sense of flowing time.
