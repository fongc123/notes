<span style = "color:lightblue">Multivariate data</span> consists of data with **high dimensionality**, where the correlations between the attributes in the data are investigated.

| **Terminology**  |                **Definition**                |
|:----------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
|    Dimensions    |         Key attributes (independent)         |
|    Variables     |         Value attributes (dependent)         |
| Multidimensional | Dimensionality of the independent dimensions |
|   Multivariate   |  Dimensionality of the dependent variables   |

The following approaches can be used to generate visualizations of multivariate data: **geometric projection**, **pixel-oriented** (i.e., layout density), **hierarchical display**, and **iconography**.

# Geometric Projection
In <span style = "color:lightblue">geometric projection</span>, multidimensional datasets are mapped to a dimensional or arbitrary space.

It can handle **large datasets** and can **detect outliers and correlation**; however, data attributes may not be **perceived equally** and **visual cluttering** may occur.
