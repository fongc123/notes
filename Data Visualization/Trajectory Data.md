<span style = "color:lightblue">Trajectory data</span> is information about entities in motion.  Relevant application domains include but are not limited to tourism, urban planning, and aviation. Basic characteristics of trajectory data include **geometric shape**, **length** (*distance traveled*), **duration** (*time traveled*), **speed**, and **direction**.

Data preprocessing for trajectory data involves **sampling** and **interpolation**. Additionally, data calibration maps the trajectory onto a
