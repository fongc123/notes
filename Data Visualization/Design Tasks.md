# Design Tasks

Task design pertain to the purpose of the visualization (i.e., overall message) $\rightarrow$ how it is conveyed. <span style = "color:lightblue">Bertin's three stages for reading a graphic</span> describes how people read a graph.
- external, internal, relationships

<span style = "color:lightblue">Reading level</span>: elementary, intermediate, overall

## Task Abstraction

Tasks are domain-dependent; however, these tasks can be abstracted. Similar task abstractions have similar solutions.

$$\text{task}\rightarrow\text{verb (action)}+\text{noun (target)}$$
### Verb: Analyze
Consume: discover, present, enjoy (for fun). The `consume` category simply redistributes information.
Produce: annotate, record, derive. The `produce` category performs additional modification to the display to show more insights.

### Verb: Search

Finding for one or a group of points (locate, browse, locate, explore)

### Verb: Query

Directly find the value of a particular point, a group of points, or all the points (identify, compare, summarize).

### Target
A target refers to the subject of a visualization <u>task</u>. All data possess trends, outliers, and features, where one attribute (variable) or multiple attributes can be analyzed. Specific to network and spatial data are topologies and shapes respectively.


## Interaction Design

<span style = "color:lightblue">Interactions</span> can be implemented to handle the increasing complexity of a dataset.
- <span style = "color:lightblue">manipulate</span>: change view
- <span style = "color:lightblue">facet</span>: facet across multiple views
- <span style = "color:lightblue">reduce</span>: reduce items or attributes in a single view

Additionally, new data can be derived to show insights within the same view.

### Manipulate

Automatic? manual?

Manual $\rightarrow$ change encoding, parameters, arrangement or ordering,
