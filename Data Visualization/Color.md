# Color

Color exists to **highight**, **identify**, and **group** elements. All colors are part of the visible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (400 nm - 700 nm).

> A longer wavelength corresponds to lower energy, while a shorter wavelength corresponds to higher energy.

In the human visual system, cones and rods are responsible for perceiving colors. Three cone types (S, M, L) correspond to blue, green, and red colors. Rods are more active in darker environments.

Several color theories (color spaces) have been created to capture color information.

When color is displayed on a monitor, the RGB (additive) system is used. On the other hand, when color is printed with a printer, the CMYK (subtractive) system is used.

In data visualization, color is used to label, quantify, and highlight graphical elements. Some color selection tips are listed below.
- Red and blue should not be together.
- Blue is not sensitive to human eyes.
- Red-green is a good color combination.

**Rule One: The maximum number of colors used is normally between 6 and 12, where there is a wide range of hues.**

> [!TIP]
> Encoding certain attributes to certain colors based on their semantic meaning improves pre-attentive understanding (e.g., <span style = "color:lightgreen">correct</span>, <span style = "color:red">wrong</span>).

Color palettes should be colorful, robust, and perceptually uniform. This [site](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) aids in color palette selection in visualization.
