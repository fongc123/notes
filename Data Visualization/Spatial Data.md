# Spatial Data
<span style = "color:lightblue">Cartography</span> refers to the process of creating a map from geometry data.

There are several ways to project spatial information on a two-dimensional graph.

The scale of the map should also be considered.

## Choropleth
A <span style = "color:lightblue">choropleth map</span> categorically encodes different regions on a map by color.

## Symbol
A <span style = "color:lightblue">symbol map</span> encodes the quality or quantity of spatial regions with marks and symbols. Examples include **dot map**, **bubble map**, **spatial heatmap**, and **isoline map** (*an alternative heatmap*).


In dense data, visual occlusion may occur, which may affect the representation of the data.

## Cartogram
A <span style = "color:lightblue">cartogram</span> is an alternative to [[#Choropleth|choropleth maps]] and distorts geographical regions to directly use area to encode attributes.

## Flow
In a <span style = "color:lightblue">flow map</span>, lines are used to show movement between spatial regions rather than symbols or color.

This example (https://hint.fm/wind/) is a wind map of the United States.

## Others
Additional chart types include **transit maps**, which are used for transportation maps, and **prism maps**, which create a [[Design Rules#3D|justified three-dimensional]] view of a map.
