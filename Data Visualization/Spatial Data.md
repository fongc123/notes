# Spatial Data
<span style = "color:lightblue">Cartography</span> refers to the process of creating a map from geometry data.

There are several ways to project spatial information on a two-dimensional graph.

The scale of the map should also be considered.

## Choropleth
A <span style = "color:lightblue">choropleth map</span> categorically encodes different regions on a map by color.

## Symbol
A <span style = "color:lightblue">symbol map</span> encodes the quality or quantity of spatial regions with marks and symbols. Examples include **dot map**, **bubble map**, and **spatial heatmap**.

In dense data, visual occlusion may occur, which may affect the representation of the data.
