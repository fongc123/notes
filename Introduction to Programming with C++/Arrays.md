# Arrays
Arrays allow information to be grouped under one identifier. An <span style = "color:lightblue">array</span> is a collection of <span style = "color:lightblue">homogeneous objects</span> (i.e., objects of the same type).
## 1D Array
The syntax of initializing an array is shown below. The size of the array must be a positive constant.

```C++
<DATA_TYPE> <ARRAY_NAME> [ <SIZE> ];
```

Additionally, the syntax of assigning a value at a specified index of an array is shown below.

```C++
<ARRAY_NAME> [ <INDEX ] = <VALUE>;
```

Each element is stored consecutively in memory and **takes up space** equivalent to the **size of the data type**.
