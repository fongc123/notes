# C String
In C++, <span style = "color:lightblue">Strings</span> have their own <span style = "color:lightblue">class</span> and are part of the `cstring` library. Strings are not a basic data type. Although they are represented as **an array of characters**, a simple `char` array is different from a C string.

## Representation
Strings are represented by a one-dimensional character array in which the last element is the <span style = "color:lightblue">null character</span> (``)
